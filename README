This repository contains the sources for building one of 3 ubuntu deb packages 
that together make up the dynamic router lite project (DynrLite-II).

The DynrLite-II project allows placing a so called dynamic router between a lan
that contains workstations and a lan that contains internet gateways. The dynamic 
router has a simple web interface that lets the users on the workstations pick
or switch what gateway they want to use. 

The dynr-pbrouting package provides the core policy based routing package consisting of
an upstart startup and teardown script, a dbus service and a simple commandline tool for
administration purposes. The dynr-pbrouting package is written purely in python and leans
heavily on functionality provided by iproute2.

Other components of the DynrLite-II project are dynr-pbdns (A policy based dns forwarder)
and dynr-web (the web interface),

All DynrLite-II packages are distributed by the dutch national police agency (KLPD) under
the LGPL open source software licence.
